                <h2>Culture ü´∂ Tradition</h2>
                <h3>October 19th,2022</h3>
                <p>Bhutan's traditional culture is alive in its performing arts, such as dance and music, which are integral parts of ceremonies and festivals all over the country. Unlike many countries, traditional arts, age-old ceremonies, festivals, social conduct and structures are not remnants of a bygone age.</p>

        <p>Under the Driglam Choesum or Za Cha Do(e) Sum, a code of standard practices was framed, based on three kinds of human activity: eating, doing things and walking. It is said that no matter how rich a person is, he should never eat sleeping and no matter how poor a person is, he should not eat standing.  Therefore, a person eats sitting properly. A person can only eat that  amount of food which can be held within two fingers and a thumb of the right hand. He is expected to keep the drinks on the left side and the solid things to the right. A person should not pile bones in front or behind. The person keeps them inside his hemcho ( the pouch). Jokes are told about  a person who carried all the bones in his pouch and ate peacefully outside without having to fear an imposition of any discipline.

         <h2>SportsüèÖ in Bhutan</h2>
            <p>Traditional Bhutanese archery is a social event and competitions are organised between villages, towns, and amateur teams. There is usually plenty of food and drink complete with singing and dancing. Attempts to distract an opponent include standing around the target and making fun of the shooter's ability.[3][4][6] The most notable archery competition in Bhutan is the Yangphel tournament.[8][9] Other major archery competitions are held during Losar, the Bhutanese and Tibetan New Year.</p>

            <h4>Archery</h4>
         <p> khuru is a popular outdoor team sport often played during festivals and archery tournaments. When playing khuru, heavy wooden darts pointed with a 10 centimetres (3.9 in) nail are thrown at a paperback-sized target 10 metres (33 ft) to 20 metres (66 ft) away.[16][17]

            <h2>Festivalüéä</h2>
           <p>The Thimphu Tshechu festival is one of the biggest festivals in Bhutan- in terms of participation and audience. The Thimphu Tshechu festival begins on the 10th day and ends on the 12th day of the 8th Bhutanese month. Thousands of people gather to witness the Tshechu. For the Bhutanese it is an ideal time to meet with others, wear their finest attire, and receive blessings from  the sacred dances.</p>

           <h4>Tsechu festival</h4>
           <p>The beautiful Gangtey Valley is the roosting ground for the endangered black-necked crane that migrate from Tibet during winters.  The Black Necked Crane Festival  is celebrated in this valley. Black Necked Crane Festival is an event to mark the coming of a giant majestic bird which itself is a blessing to watch. It is interesting to observe that these birds, like humans, circumambulate Gangtey Goenpa on arrival and do the same on its departure. The Royal Society for Protection of Nature (RSPN), together with the Phobjikha Environment Management Committee (PEMC) will organize the Black-Necked Crane festival at the courtyard of Gangtey Gonpa.</p>

          <h4>Dzongkha language</h4>
          <p>English, although is a second language for Bhutanese, it is used as medium of instruction in education and official correspondence. It encompasses linguistic features like grammar, pronunciation, and spelling. With the introduction of the modern education system in the 1960s, the Bhutanese government not only decided to include English as a subject in the curriculum but also as the medium of instruction.</p>
